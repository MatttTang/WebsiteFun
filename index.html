                <p class="bio">
                    My name is Matthew Tang, and I am an aspiring software engineer.
                    I currently study Computer Science at Seattle Pacific University, and will be graudating in the spring of 2021.
                    My primary goal in pursuing computer science is to use technology enrich the lives of the people around me, whether they are family, friend or stranger.
                </p>

                    I grew up in Honolulu, Hawaii, but moved later to gain access to a better education. 
                    Going through an accelerated curriculum through middle school and high school, I forged a work ethic and dedication that propelled me forward,
                    which led to me graduating two years earlier than my peers.
                    Although I may lack the experience of my older peers, I am willing to make up for it through hard work and effort.
                </p>

                    Much of my work has been in C++, which I can confidently say is my strongest language.
                    I am trying to branch out and learn new technologies, and I do so through independent projects.
                    I have worked with:

                    Despite this, I am not all work. I can enjoy myself by watching "The Office" and "Parks and Rec".
                    I also play a few video games in my spare time with friends. In the future, a goal of mine is to 
                    independently create my own game. Some of the games I play often are:
